Welcome to our webpage about the San Francisco Crime Dataset, where we delve into interesting criminal activity patterns in San Francisco, with a focus on the distribution of theft related crimes over the five-year period from 2013 to 2017. Through a detailed analysis of existing crime data, the aim is to elucidate the general trend of theft and provide thoughtful recommendations.<!--more-->

## Tale features
A comprehensive investigation in San Francisco found that the incidence of theft is shocking, affecting more than half of the city's residents. These incidents involve an astonishing number of blatant car intrusions, often occurring in areas popular with tourists. This unsettling reality resonates deeply with the widespread civic disillusionment in this city. [1] To improve this situation, we first analyzed the distribution of theft in SF during a 24-hour cycle.

The data represented by the polar bar chart shows a sharp increase in theft/theft cases around 6 pm, indicating that theft is more frequent when people may be returning home from work or there is still a lot of pedestrian traffic. On the contrary, the incidence rate is lowest in the early morning around 5am, and gradually increases to the evening peak after noon.

For the entire community, as theft/theft incidents peak in the evening, individuals should be particularly vigilant when going out at dusk, especially in areas known to be crowded or with high pedestrian traffic. It is important to be more careful in protecting personal belongings and raising awareness of the surrounding environment. Consider scheduling errands at lower risk times (such as in the morning) to reduce the chances of becoming a victim of theft.

Law enforcement agencies can better protect these peak hours by allocating additional resources and patrols to prevent theft. In addition, community outreach activities can play a crucial role in educating the public to protect themselves from theft. Strategically deploying monitoring infrastructure in key areas, especially those with high incidence during peak hours, can serve both as a deterrent and an investigative role.
